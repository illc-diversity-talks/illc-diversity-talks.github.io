      Biases in the research system against underrepresented groups of researchers (e.g., against women or ethnic minorities) are extensively being studied and debated. Such biases are often seen as one of the causes of the lack of diversity in many research fields, while at the same time the lack of diversity may further reinforcesuch biases.

In this talk I will analyze how biases are being studied and how studies of biases inform policy initiatives aimed at improving diversity and inclusion in the research system. I will present a number of different perspectives taken in discussions about biases in the research system, and I will point out some of the challenges in developing a coherent understanding of these biases. At a meta level, I will reflect on the possibility that we are all biased and that, as a result, our studies of biases in the research system may also be biased themselves.

From a more practical point of view, I will discuss ongoing initiatives aimed at making the scholarly publishing system more diverse and inclusive, and I will reflect on tensions between these initiatives and other agendas aimed at improving and reforming scholarly publishing.

      <b> Abstract: </b> 
      Digital technology is playing an increasing role in our society, but women are underrepresented. Today, less than 15% of computer science students in higher education in most European countries are women.

The Covid 19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital technology in daily life and the specific challenges faced by women in times of crisis, including in education and research.

This quasi non-gender mix of the field has consequences not only on gender equality in employment, but also on the inclusiveness and performance of digital applications. The great uniformity of the population of developers and managers (white men from the middle or upper classes) tends to make the needs and characteristics of other populations, especially women, disappear.

Can we continue to be satisfied with a technical world designed, developed, installed and maintained by a population that is more than 80% male? How can we imagine a more inclusive digital world?

The higher education can close the gender gap: it is not too late and not everything happens in primary school!

This communication will include:
- a historical review of how the field became so male and why it keeps so;
- a descriptions of practices: those that are not so Â« good Â»... and those that have proven to be effective.

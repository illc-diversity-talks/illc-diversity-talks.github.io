	The ILLC Diversity Talks is an initiative of the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/AbouttheILLC/Diversity/Diversity-at-ILLC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILLC Diversity Committee</a>. <p> </p> The ILLC is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment to all members of its community regardless of background or identity. The ILLC Diversity Committee strives to uphold these values.
	
	The goal of the ILLC Diversity Talks is to show how research carried out at the ILLC interacts with recent works and findings in the area of diversity, broadly understood. 
	Distinguished speakers will present their research in a variety of fields related to diversity. These talks will be an opportunity for ILLC members to reflect on current research and practices which could foster diversity and inclusion within the institute. <p> </p>
	
	Everyone is invited to attend the talks and take part in the discussion! It will be a learning and growing experience for yourself and the whole institute.
